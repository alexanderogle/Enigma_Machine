# Enigma Machine

Warning! This code contains a minor bug (for your system)
The write out directory for the code is configured specifically
for my little brother's laptop. You will need to change this line of
code to get it to run properly.

This code is written for Python 2.7 (sorry, I wrote it a few years back).
It is really just for sending fun encoded emails to my friends and little brother.
And for learning some basics of python.
